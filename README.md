# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description

During this project we were asked to review the landing page index.html and style.css files to ensure that the code follows accessibility guidelines. This project allows individuals that use screen readers to better understand the landing page content. 

During the project I learned about div soup and how it can be very confusing for coders that follow. I also learned how to add an image as a backgound on a site through the style.css and still make the image follow accessibility guidelines. 

Another important item I learned was that when dealing with div soup, comments can be extremely beneficial when you need to divide up the code. It made it more understandable and easier to work with.
